    <p class = "animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">
        As a pizza delivery driver in my hometown, I have always thought about building an application that 
        tracks my yearly statistics of driving. For instance, how much money I've made over the past year, 
        how much I've spent on gas, how much money in tips, how much did i get in pay, etc.  
    </p>
    <p class = "animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">
        I've also been very interested in the architecture of an application, front, middle, and backend, 
        and how it works.  So I will build an application using a REST api and an RDS databse that calculates
        yearly statistics that I can track at any point. I will post any and all skills i have learned in the skills page 
        of this site, and the source code for all of this can be found on my GitHub.
    </p>

        At this point in time, the project is still under development and is not up and running.
